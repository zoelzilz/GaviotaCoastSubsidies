## Goals
To visualize where on the planet marine to terrestrial subsidies are important or at least studied

To create the following figure(s):
1. Global map of where resource subsidy studies have been carried out
2. brown for terrestrial movement, blue for marine to terrestrial movement
3. red circle around?? for mediterranean, or we can color med zones differently

# note when pulling in new versions of the csv that I had to manually go into excel and make sure that when a paper was associated with multiple rows, identical data was filled out for each (undergrad left these blank instead)

global <- read_csv("global_subsidies.csv") %>% # pull in csv 
  clean_names() %>%   #snake case
  rename(ecotone = ecotone_ecosystem_boundary,
         mediterranean = mediterannean_yes) %>%
  filter(empirical_data == "Yes", #only pick rows where studies had empirical data
         ecotone != "Lab setting",
         ecotone != "n/a") %>%  # get rid of these bois
  mutate(mediterranean = case_when(mediterranean == "Y" ~ "Yes",
            mediterranean == "N"                    # this is the syntax for "rename values in this column this way"... although there might be a simpler way
            | mediterranean== "n/a" 
            | mediterranean=="LABORATORY" ~ "No",
            TRUE ~ as.character(mediterranean))) %>%  # catch all to not throw out things that don't match the above
  separate(lat_lon, # need to find a way to split lat lon into two columns
           c("lat","lon"), # names of new columns
           "," # character to separate by
           ) %>% 
  mutate(lat=as.numeric(lat)) %>% 
  mutate(lon=as.numeric(lon))

class(global$lon) #whyyyy is it character



```
We want to write up some summary tables for the global data. Our questions are:
1. what percent of global subsidy studies focused on land to sea subsidies?
2. what percent focused on mediterannean areas?
3. what percent of mediterannean studies were land to sea subsidies?
```{r summary stats}
summary <- with(global, table(ecotone, mediterranean))

med_count <- as.data.frame(table(global$mediterranean)) %>% # give me the frequency of Yes/No in the mediterranean col
  #pivot_wider() %>% # not sure if this is necessary?
  rename(Med = Var1,
         Count = Freq)
29/294
# ~ 10%

marine_count <- as.data.frame(table(global$ecotone)) %>% # give me the frequency of ecotones in data
  #pivot_wider() %>% # not sure if this is necessary?
  rename(Ecotone = Var1,
         Count = Freq)

# percent of subsidy literature focusing on marine > terrestrial
155/327
#[1] 0.4740061

medit <- global %>% 
  filter(mediterranean == "Yes")

med_marine_count <- as.data.frame(table(medit$ecotone)) %>% # give me the frequency of ecotones in data
  rename(Ecotone = Var1,
         Count = Freq)

16/29
# 55%

medmarinecount_fig <- ggplot(med_marine_count) +
  geom_col(aes(x = Ecotone, y = Count, fill = I("dodgerblue4")))+ #i'm not sure why in the syntax I is required but I'd liek to figure it out // this color matches caption color
  ylab("Number of Studies")+
  xlab("Donor and Recipient Ecosystems")+
  theme_classic()+
  theme(axis.text.y=element_text(size = 16),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 15),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 24),
        axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 15, r = 10, b = 10, l = 1))) #margin = margin() increases distance around the axis label

png(filename = "med_marine_count_fig.png",
    width = 850, height = 500, units = "px")
medmarinecount_fig
dev.off()
  
```

Now we want to create the map
- to color the countries in we have to join our dataframe with the dataframe that creates the data for world, which sounds unwieldy and I dont want to: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63858603/color-only-specific-countries-based-on-values-in-a-different-data-frame

```{r map}

         "blue",
         "tan",
         "tan1",
         "tan4"
        )
# getting map with ggmap

world <- map_data("world")
biogeo<- ggplot(world, aes(x=long, y=lat))+
  geom_polygon(aes(group = group))+
  geom_point(shape = 1, size = 3, stroke = 1.5, aes(y = lat, x = lon, colour = ecotone), data = global)+
  scale_colour_manual(values = pal, name = "Donor and Recipient Ecosystem")+
  theme_void()+
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill='transparent'), #transparent panel bg
    plot.background = element_rect(fill='transparent', color=NA), #transparent plot bg
    legend.background = element_rect(fill='transparent'), #transparent legend bg

#What kind of subsidies exist in Mediterranean climate zones?
Now we want to summarize subsidy data for Mediterannean climate zones. What types of subsidies are common? Who benefits from them?

```{r}
medit <- global %>% 
  filter(mediterannean == "Yes")
```
